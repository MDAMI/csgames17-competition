## Solution details

_Here, explain how the challenge went. Some examples of what we'd like to read here:_

- _What did you wanted to do at first?_
  - I was hoping to implement full registration with the ability to upload your own photos
- _What did you end up doing?_
- _How did it go, overall? Do you think you have succeeded?_
  - It went decently, all things considered, though I wouldn't call this a success. Working alone, on tech that I've only messed with tangentially meant that there was a steep learning curve in the first hour or so, just familiarizing myself with the environment.
- _Is there anything that **blocked** you?_
  - The lack of cell signal to complete AWS Account Verification.
- _Is there anything that you are **proud of**?_
  - I got farther than I thought I would.

_A couple of lines should be enough, just make sure we have a clear idea of what you did, so we can rate your **whole participation** and not just your **final result**._
